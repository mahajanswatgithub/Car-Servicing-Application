## OOPS Concepts Used
In the Car Service Bill Generator code provided, several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts have been utilized. Here are the OOP concepts used in the implementation:

1.Classes and Objects:

- The **```Car```** class represents different types of cars. It encapsulates the carType attribute and provides a getter method to retrieve the car type.
- The **```Service```** class represents the different services offered at the service station. It encapsulates attributes like serviceCode, serviceName, hatchbackPrice, sedanPrice, and suvPrice. It also provides methods to access these attributes.
- The **```ServiceStation```** class is responsible for managing the available services. It maintains a list of Service objects and provides a method to find a service by its code.

2.Encapsulation:

- All classes encapsulate their internal attributes, providing controlled access through getter methods. This helps in maintaining data integrity and controlling access to internal data.
